Foreword
by Larry "Laundromat Larry" Larsen
Founder of Laundromat123.com | 50+ Years in the Industry

The laundromat business isn't complicated - it's just unforgiving.

You either do your homework, or the industry will educate you the hard way. And trust me, that education costs a hell of a lot more than any book or consultation ever will.

I've been in this business for over fifty years. I've seen everything - the booms, the busts, the operators who made millions and the ones who lost their shirts. The difference between them wasn't luck. It was preparation.

Nick Kremers knows this world from the ground up. Three generations of Arkansas laundry blood runs through his veins:

Jerry Kremers hauling coin boxes through backroads in a beat-up pickup
Guy Kremers fixing Dexters by hand during power outages
Nick dragging himself back from a wheelchair after a stroke at 36 to re-engineer what "modern laundry intelligence" really means
This book is different because it's lived - not just learned.

Nick takes every scar, every repair bill, every late-night cleanout and turns it into structure. He understands that the coin laundromat business is a systems game. You win by design, not by luck.

I've been doing this longer than most people have been alive. And I can tell you: the principles in this book are the same ones that separate the operators who thrive from the ones who barely survive.

What I've added to this book:

Over the years, I've written extensively about the topics that trip up most operators - insurance coverage gaps that leave you exposed, fire hazards that destroy stores overnight, lease traps that kill your exit options, and equipment decisions that cost you tens of thousands. Nick and I have combined our knowledge into something I wish I'd had when I started fifty years ago.

If you read this book carefully - and more importantly, apply it - you'll not only learn how to buy, build, and run a profitable laundromat, but how to build a real foundation that protects your investment and your family.

This is the blueprint I wish every new owner had.

Preface: Legacy and Grit
This book was born from grease, debt, and stubbornness.

I grew up with it - the smell of soap and lint, the clang of quarters in my grandfather's Speed Queen machines. I've seen this business at its best and worst - when the dryers hum with profit and when leaks eat away at your sanity.

But more than that, I've seen what the right structure can do.

Let me tell you about my family.

Grandpa Jerry ran Speed Queen routes through Arkansas long before "passive income" was a buzzword. He'd drive that old Ford pickup from store to store, hauling coin boxes that weighed more than my backpack ever did. He taught me that clean clothes were just the surface - the real business was dependability.

Dad (Guy Kremers) carried the torch with Kremers Laundry Equipment Company. He sold, repaired, and designed laundromats back when everything was still quarters and keys. He rebuilt Maytag 5-light top loaders, installed Dexters, and designed self-service layouts that still stand today. I grew up in the back of that service truck. My first toolkit came before my first report card.

Then came me - the third generation. I learned to lift machines before I learned to balance a checkbook.

The Stroke That Changed Everything
That legacy didn't end when a stroke almost took me out at 35.

One day I'm running service calls. The next day I'm in a hospital bed wondering if I'll ever walk again.

But here's the thing about the Kremers way: we don't quit. We adapt.

What started as survival became a doctrine - structure, discipline, and accountability. The same systems thinking that makes a laundromat profitable is what got me back on my feet.

That mindset drives this book.

Why This Book Exists
A laundromat is one of the last true neighborhood businesses that can still change a life if you do it right - with heart, discipline, and a little grit.

This book isn't theory. It's a manual forged from experience - from our family's three-generation playbook, combined with today's tools and truths. Add in Larry Larsen's fifty-plus years of industry expertise, and you've got more combined laundromat knowledge than just about anywhere else on the planet.

What You'll Learn:

How to evaluate locations using the C.L.E.A.N. methodology
Equipment selection strategies that maximize ROI
The softmount vs. hardmount debate - finally settled
Lease negotiation tactics that protect your investment
Insurance coverage requirements that actually protect you
Fire prevention protocols that save lives and stores
Operational systems that scale across multiple stores
Marketing strategies that actually drive revenue
Exit planning that maximizes business value
The complete Kremers Doctrine (C.L.E.A.N., W.A.S.H., L.A.U.N.D.R.Y., S.O.A.P., D.R.Y.)
Who This Book Is For:

First-time laundromat buyers evaluating opportunities
Current operators looking to optimize existing stores
Investors seeking to add laundromats to their portfolio
Single parents building a business while raising a family
Anyone rebuilding after setbacks (like I did)
Equipment distributors wanting to understand buyer perspectives
Let's get to work.

PART I
FOUNDATIONS OF A LEGACY

DOCTRINE PRINCIPLE

"You don't just build a laundromat. You architect one - every lease, machine, and inch of tile is a decision that either compounds or collapses."


Chapter 1: The Three-Generation Blueprint

The Kremers family didn't find the laundry business - it found us.

My grandfather Jerry ran Speed Queen routes through Arkansas long before "passive income" was a buzzword. He taught me that clean clothes were just the surface - the real business was dependability.

Dad carried the torch with Kremers Laundry Equipment Company. He sold, repaired, and designed laundromats back when everything was still quarters and keys. He rebuilt Maytag 5-light top loaders, installed Dexters, and designed self-service layouts that still stand today.

Then came me - the third generation. I grew up in the back of a service truck. My first toolkit came before my first report card. I learned to lift machines before I learned to balance a checkbook.

The Stroke That Changed Everything
That legacy didn't end when a stroke almost took me out at 35. It just shifted focus.

What started as survival became a doctrine - structure, discipline, and accountability. That same mindset drives this book.

The Modern Approach
You don't just build a laundromat. You architect one - every lease, machine, and inch of tile is a decision that either compounds or collapses.

The Three Pillars of the Kremers Way
Pillar	Principle	Application
1. Foundation First	Location and lease determine 80% of success	Never compromise on site selection
2. Systems Over Hustle	Design beats improvisation every time	Document everything, automate what you can
3. Numbers Don't Lie	Track metrics religiously or fail slowly	Weekly reviews, monthly deep-dives
That's the Kremers way. That's what this book will teach you.

The Evolution of the Industry
Era	Technology	Revenue Model	Key Challenge
1950s-1970s	Coin-op only	Quarters	Machine reliability
1980s-1990s	Card readers emerge	Mixed payment	Customer education
2000s-2010s	Digital payments	Cards + coins	Technology adoption
2020s+	App-based, IoT	Subscription + per-use	Integration complexity
The business has changed. The fundamentals haven't.

Chapter 2: The Truth About This Business

Let's be real: laundromats are not "easy money."

They're steady money if you design them right.
They're freedom if you manage them like a business, not a hobby.
And they're hell if you skip due diligence.

Why First-Time Buyers Fail
There's a reason so many first-time buyers fail - they chase revenue and ignore rent. They look at the quarters, not the cracks in the lease.

The Top 10 Reasons Laundromat Buyers Fail:

Paid too much - Bought on emotion, not numbers
Bad lease - Short terms, high rent, no protections
Wrong location - Low density, bad demographics
Undercapitalized - No reserve for repairs or slow months
Poor due diligence - Trusted seller's numbers without verification
Equipment neglect - Deferred maintenance until breakdown
No systems - Winging it instead of designing processes
Utility ignorance - Water/gas eating all the profit
Competition blind - New store opened next door
Burnout - Treated it as a job, not a business
The Four Organs of a Laundromat
You're buying a living, breathing ecosystem. Every laundromat has four main organs:

Organ	What It Does	If It Fails
Lease	Controls your existence	Slow death - can't control costs, can't sell
Equipment	Generates revenue	Lost revenue, angry customers, repair spiral
Utilities	Enables operations	Profits evaporate silently
Community	Brings customers	Empty machines, declining revenue
If one of those fails, the body starts to die.

The Core Principle
Every chapter in this book comes back to one core principle:

"Form over function. Structure over emotion. Design over guesswork."

When you treat your laundromat like a living system - not a side hustle - it rewards you with freedom, recurring revenue, and longevity.

Reality Check: The Numbers
Typical Laundromat Economics:

Metric	Range	Notes
Annual Revenue	$100K-$500K	Varies by size and location
Net Margin	25-40%	Well-run stores hit 35%+
Payback Period	4-7 years	Faster if you optimize
Time to Breakeven	18-36 months	New builds take longer
Active Management	10-20 hrs/week	Initially; decreases with systems
Revenue Breakdown (Typical Store):

Source	Percentage
Self-service washers	50-60%
Self-service dryers	25-30%
Wash-dry-fold service	10-20%
Vending/other	2-5%
Expense Breakdown (Typical Store):

Category	Percentage of Revenue
Rent	15-25%
Utilities	15-25%
Labor	5-15%
Maintenance/Repairs	5-10%
Insurance	2-4%
Supplies	2-4%
Other (marketing, etc.)	3-5%
Net Profit	25-40%
This isn't passive income. It's systematized income.


✎ WORKBOOK: Financial Reality Check
Calculate YOUR numbers before you buy:


Target Store Revenue: $________/year

Apply Standard Percentages:

Expense	%	Your Amount
Rent	20%	$_________
Utilities	20%	$_________
Labor	10%	$_________
Maintenance	7%	$_________
Insurance	3%	$_________
Supplies	3%	$_________
Other	4%	$_________
Total Expenses	67%	$_________
Net Profit	33%	$_________
Reality Check:

Is the net profit enough to cover your loan payments? [ ] Yes [ ] No
Is there cushion for unexpected repairs? [ ] Yes [ ] No
Can you survive 3 slow months? [ ] Yes [ ] No
Chapter 3: Location Is Law

You can fix equipment. You can renegotiate rent.
But you can't fix a bad location.

If you ignore this law, the business gods will punish you every month with low turns and high regret.

Location determines 80% of your success.
Let that sink in. You could have the best equipment, the cleanest store, the friendliest staff - and still fail because you picked the wrong spot.

What to Look For: The Location Checklist
Must-Have Criteria:

Factor	Minimum Standard	Ideal
Renter households (1 mi)	1,500+	3,000+
Visibility	Main road access	Corner lot with signage
Parking	1.5 spaces per washer	2 spaces per washer
Competition	≤2 within 1 mile	0-1 within 1 mile
Median income	$30K-$65K	$35K-$55K
Population trend	Stable	Growing
The C.L.E.A.N. Principle
The Kremers doctrine uses C.L.E.A.N. for every potential location:

Letter	Principle	What to Check
C	Community Fit	Who are you serving? Demographics, density, needs
L	Lease Logic	Are the terms sustainable? Length, rent, options
E	Equipment Mix	Is it balanced for volume? Size distribution
A	Accessibility	Parking, traffic flow, safety, visibility
N	Numbers	Rent ratio, utilities, projected EBITDA
Run these checks before you ever sign a lease.

Chapter 4: Lease Logic and Negotiation Survival

Bad leases ruin good businesses.
A perfect location with a bad lease is still a ticking time bomb.

I've seen it too many times: an operator finds a great spot, gets excited, signs whatever the landlord puts in front of them, and three years later they're wondering why they can't sell their business.

The answer is always the lease.

Lease Essentials: What You Must Have
Non-Negotiable Terms:

Term	Minimum	Why It Matters
Initial term	10 years	Gives you time to recoup investment
Renewal options	2 x 5-year	Protects future value
Exclusivity clause	Yes	No competing laundromat in center
Assignment rights	Yes	Ability to sell the business
Rent cap on renewals	3-5% annual max	Predictable costs
CAM caps	Yes	Control common area charges
HVAC responsibility	Landlord	Major expense avoidance
Larry's Advanced Lease Negotiating Tactics

PART II
BUILDING THE MACHINE

DOCTRINE PRINCIPLE

"Equipment is the engine. The right mix is the horsepower. The wrong mix is dead weight."


Chapter 5: Equipment Intelligence

Your equipment is your revenue engine. Every machine is a profit center - or a liability.

The Equipment Selection Framework
Step 1: Determine Your Market

Market Type	Customer Profile	Equipment Focus
Budget	Price-sensitive, high volume	Top loaders, basic front loaders
Standard	Mixed demographics	Balance of sizes and features
Premium	Time-conscious, quality-focused	Large capacity, express cycles
Boutique	Upscale, service-oriented	High-end, specialty features
Step 2: Calculate Your Equipment Mix

The ideal ratio depends on your market, but here's a starting framework:

Machine Type	Percentage of Washers	Revenue Contribution
Small (20-30 lb)	30-40%	35-45%
Medium (40-50 lb)	35-45%	30-35%
Large (60-80 lb)	15-25%	20-30%
XL (80+ lb)	5-10%	5-10%
Dryer Ratio Rule: 1.5-2 dryer pockets per washer

Brand Comparison
Brand	Pros	Cons	Best For
Speed Queen	Legendary durability, strong dealer network	Premium price, traditional	Long-term operators
Dexter	Good value, solid performance, DexterLive	Mid-range reliability	Cost-conscious buyers
Continental	High efficiency, good warranty	Smaller dealer network	Energy-focused markets
Huebsch	Alliance quality, competitive pricing	Less brand recognition	Value seekers
Electrolux	Premium features, efficiency	Parts availability, cost	High-end markets

Chapter 6: The Great Debate - Softmount vs. Hardmount

This chapter draws from Larry Larsen's extensive writings on equipment selection

The softmount vs. hardmount debate has divided the industry for decades. Here's the definitive breakdown.

What's the Difference?
Hardmount Washers:

Bolted directly to concrete slab
Require 8-12 inch reinforced concrete pad
Lower spin speeds (typically 100-200 G-force)
More water left in clothes after wash
Softmount Washers:

Free-standing on rubber isolators
No special floor requirements
Higher spin speeds (300-400+ G-force)
Clothes come out drier
Figure 6.1: Softmount vs. Hardmount Visual Comparison
Softmount vs Hardmount Comparison

Side-by-side comparison of hardmount (concrete pad) vs softmount (rubber isolators) installations.

Figure 6.2: Total Cost of Ownership Over 15 Years
15-Year Total Cost Comparison

Softmount saves $19,000 over 15 years through reduced dryer time and installation costs.

The Comparison
Factor	Hardmount	Softmount
Installation Cost	Higher (concrete work)	Lower (no floor prep)
Spin Speed	100-200 G-force	300-400+ G-force
Moisture Retention	50-60%	30-40%
Dryer Time Savings	Baseline	30-40% less
Floor Requirements	8-12" reinforced slab	Standard floor
Maintenance	Lower long-term	Slightly higher
Lifespan	20-25 years	15-20 years
Noise Level	Higher	Lower (isolated)
Initial Cost	Lower	Higher
The Real Calculation: Total Cost of Ownership
Softmount Advantages That Save Money:

Dryer Energy Savings

30-40% less moisture = 30-40% less dryer time
Average savings: $0.10-0.15 per wash cycle in gas costs
Annual savings on busy store: $3,000-$8,000
Customer Satisfaction

Faster total laundry time
Less wear on dryers
Higher customer retention
Flexibility

Can be relocated if needed
No slab demolition for replacement
Easier to reconfigure layout
Hardmount Advantages:

Longevity

20-25 year lifespan vs. 15-20 for softmount
Lower vibration stress on components
Lower Initial Equipment Cost

15-25% less per machine
But installation costs can offset this
Maintenance

Fewer moving parts in suspension
Simpler long-term maintenance
Larry's Recommendation
"In 2025, softmount makes sense for most new installations. The energy savings and customer preference for faster cycles outweigh the slightly shorter lifespan. But if you're buying an existing store with well-maintained hardmount machines, there's no reason to rip them out." - Larry Larsen

When to Choose Hardmount:

Buying existing store with hardmount in good condition
Very long-term ownership horizon (20+ years)
Areas with very low utility costs
Buildings with excellent concrete slabs already
When to Choose Softmount:

New construction or retool
High utility costs
Customer base values speed
Flexibility is important
Standard flooring already in place
Chapter 7: Top Loaders - Myths, Truths, and When They Make Sense

Based on Larry Larsen's analysis of top loader economics

Top loaders have been written off by many industry "experts." But in certain markets, they're still the right choice.

The Myths
Myth 1: "Top loaders are obsolete" Truth: In price-sensitive markets, top loaders remain profitable due to lower vend prices and customer familiarity.

Myth 2: "Front loaders are always more efficient" Truth: Modern top loaders have improved significantly. The efficiency gap has narrowed.

Myth 3: "No one wants to use top loaders" Truth: Many customers prefer them - familiar operation, no bending, perceived gentler on clothes.

When Top Loaders Make Sense
Factor	Top Loader Advantage	Front Loader Advantage
Customer demographics	Older, price-sensitive	Younger, efficiency-focused
Market positioning	Budget-friendly	Premium service
Space constraints	Smaller footprint	Stackable options
Initial investment	Lower cost per machine	Higher revenue per machine
Maintenance complexity	Simpler mechanics	More complex
The Economics
Top Loader:

Equipment cost: $2,200-$3,500
Vend price: $2.50-$4.00
Water usage: 20-25 gallons per cycle
Revenue per sq ft: Lower
Customer segment: Budget-conscious
Front Loader (equivalent capacity):

Equipment cost: $4,500-$8,000
Vend price: $4.00-$7.00
Water usage: 10-15 gallons per cycle
Revenue per sq ft: Higher
Customer segment: Time-conscious
The Hybrid Approach
Many successful operators use a mix:

Store Section	Machine Type	Purpose
Economy row	Top loaders (20-30 lb)	Capture budget customers
Standard section	Front loaders (40-60 lb)	Main revenue driver
Premium section	Large front loaders (60-80 lb)	High-margin, convenience
This approach:

Serves all customer segments
Maximizes revenue per square foot
Provides pricing flexibility
Reduces customer wait times
Chapter 8: Design, Layout, and Customer Flow

Good layout is silent selling. Bad layout is silent killing.

Design Principles
The Flow Triangle: Every customer follows a path: Enter → Wash → Dry → Fold → Exit

Design your layout to make this path intuitive and efficient.

Key Design Rules:

Washers near entrance - Customers enter with dirty clothes
Dryers in middle or back - Natural flow direction
Folding tables near dryers - Minimize carry distance
Exit path clear - Easy departure with clean clothes
Sight lines open - Security and supervision
Sample Floor Plans
The following layouts demonstrate proven configurations for different store types and sizes.

Chapter 11: Insurance & Liability Protection - Larry's Complete Guide

This chapter draws from Larry Larsen's extensive experience with insurance claims and industry-specific coverage requirements

Insurance isn't sexy, but it's essential. I've seen operators lose everything because they had the wrong coverage - or thought they had coverage they didn't.

Why Standard Business Insurance Isn't Enough
Most general business insurance policies don't understand laundromats. They're written for retail stores, offices, or restaurants. A laundromat has unique risks:

Water damage - Machines, plumbing, floods
Fire hazards - Dryers, lint, gas lines
Slip and fall - Wet floors, spilled detergent
Equipment breakdown - Expensive machinery
Lost income - Machine downtime
Essential Coverage Types
Coverage Type	What It Covers	Minimum Recommendation
General Liability	Customer injuries, property damage	$1M per occurrence, $2M aggregate
Property Insurance	Building, equipment, improvements	Replacement cost, not actual value
Equipment Breakdown	Mechanical/electrical failure	Full equipment value
Business Interruption	Lost income during closure	6-12 months of revenue
Workers' Comp	Employee injuries	State minimum + umbrella
Umbrella Policy	Extended liability protection	$1M-$5M depending on assets
Coverage Gaps to Watch For
From Larry's analysis of common claim denials

Gap 1: Equipment Breakdown Exclusion Many property policies exclude mechanical and electrical breakdown. You need a separate equipment breakdown policy.

Gap 2: Flood Exclusion Standard property policies exclude flood damage. In a laundromat, water damage from your own equipment may or may not be covered.

Gap 3: Business Interruption Waiting Period Most policies have a 72-hour waiting period before coverage kicks in. For a laundromat, that's significant lost revenue.

Gap 4: Actual Cash Value vs. Replacement Cost Actual cash value (ACV) gives you depreciated value. A 10-year-old washer might be worth $500 under ACV but cost $8,000 to replace.

Gap 5: Ordinance or Law Coverage If your building doesn't meet current codes, you may be required to upgrade during repairs. Standard policies don't cover this.

Liability Claims: Understanding the Risks
Larry's insights from decades of industry experience

Most Common Laundromat Liability Claims:

Slip and Fall - Wet floors, parking lot
Property Damage - Customer's clothes damaged in machine
Child Injury - Kids hurt on equipment or in facility
Vehicle Incidents - Parking lot accidents
Chemical Exposure - Allergic reactions, spills
How to Protect Yourself:

Risk	Protection Measure	Documentation
Slip and fall	Wet floor signs, regular mopping	Photo logs, maintenance records
Property damage	Machine maintenance, clear signage	Maintenance logs, posted policies
Child injury	Warning signs, attendant presence	Posted rules, camera footage
Vehicle incidents	Clear markings, adequate lighting	Property maintenance records
Chemical exposure	Proper ventilation, SDS sheets	Training records, material logs
Increasing Liability Coverage: When and How Much
"Carry more liability coverage than you think you need. The cost difference between $1M and $2M is minimal, but the protection difference is enormous." - Larry Larsen

Factors That Require Higher Limits:

Higher customer volume
24-hour operations
Older buildings
Multiple locations
Wash-dry-fold services
Pickup and delivery services
High-value neighboring businesses

Chapter 13: Staffing and Human Systems

You can't automate people - but you can build systems that keep them accountable.

Even if you're self-service only, you'll eventually deal with attendants, cleaners, or maintenance techs. The question is: will they work for you, or will you work for them?

Attendant Structure
Staffing Ratios:

Store Size	Peak Hours	Off-Peak	Recommendation
Under 1,500 sq ft	1 attendant	0 (cameras)	Part-time cleaner
1,500-2,500 sq ft	1 attendant	1 attendant	Full coverage
2,500+ sq ft	2 attendants	1 attendant	Manager + staff
Attendant Responsibilities:

Category	Tasks
Cleaning	Floors, tables, restrooms, machines
Restocking	Soap, vending, supplies, change
Customer Service	Greeting, machine help, complaints
Security	Monitoring cameras, incident response
Reporting	Cash counts, machine issues, daily log
Reducing Employee Theft
From Larry Larsen's industry experience

Employee theft is a significant issue in cash-heavy businesses. Here's how to minimize it:

Prevention Strategies:

Strategy	Implementation	Effectiveness
Dual control	Two people for cash counting	High
Random audits	Unannounced cash counts	High
Camera coverage	All cash handling areas	High
Clear policies	Written, signed, enforced	Medium-High
Background checks	All employees	Medium
Incentive alignment	Bonuses tied to revenue	Medium
Red Flags to Watch:

Cash discrepancies between collections
Missing maintenance records
Unusual patterns in machine down reports
Employees arriving early or staying late unnecessarily
Resistance to schedule changes
Lifestyle inconsistent with income
Partially Attended vs. Fully Attended Models
Larry's analysis of staffing models

Model	Pros	Cons	Best For
Unattended	Lowest labor cost	Security concerns, less customer service	Low-crime areas, small stores
Partially Attended	Balance of cost/service	Scheduling complexity	Most markets
Fully Attended	Best customer service, security	Highest labor cost	WDF-focused, premium markets
Leadership Mindset
Your job isn't to do everything - it's to design a system where everything gets done without you.

The Doctrine Reminder
"Leadership is architecture. You don't micromanage bolts - you build blueprints that hold."

I've boiled down three generations of Kremers knowledge plus Larry's fifty years into five doctrine frameworks. Master these, and you'll outperform 90% of operators.

C.L.E.A.N. - The Five Pillars of Location
Letter	Principle	Application
C	Customers First	Experience drives retention. Clean store, working machines, friendly service.
L	Location Matters	Prime real estate beats big spend. 80% of success is picking the right spot.
E	Efficiency Wins	Machines, utilities, staffing in harmony. Every dollar saved drops to the bottom line.
A	Adapt & Innovate	Cashless, pickup/delivery, hybridize. Stay ahead or get left behind.
N	Numbers Don't Lie	Track ROI, TPD, cost per turn weekly. If you can't measure it, you can't manage it.
W.A.S.H. - The Laws of Operation
Letter	Principle	Application
W	Work the Business	Laundromats are not "set and forget." Regular presence, even if brief, matters.
A	Align with Market	Know demographics, price to fit. Don't price yourself out or undervalue your service.
S	Scale Smart	Upgrade slowly, measure before expanding. Master one store before adding another.
H	Harness Trends	Sustainability, tech, boutique models. The industry is evolving - evolve with it.
L.A.U.N.D.R.Y. - The Growth Ladder
Letter	Stage	What It Means
L	Learn	Master fundamentals before buying. Read, study, visit 50 laundromats.
A	Acquire	Secure location and financing. Don't rush - the right deal is worth waiting for.
U	Upgrade	Invest in better machines and systems. Continuous improvement compounds.
N	Niche	Differentiate - self-service, WDF, delivery, boutique. Find your lane.
D	Deliver	Execute operations flawlessly. Consistency beats occasional excellence.
R	Reinforce	Strengthen brand and loyalty. Reputation is your moat.
Y	Yield	Grow profits, add stores, or sell high. Harvest what you've built.
S.O.A.P. - Daily Discipline
Letter	Principle	Daily Action
S	Systems Check	Verify utilities, changers, machines every day. Catch problems before customers do.
O	Observe Customers	Watch interactions with space. What frustrates them? What delights them?
A	Adjust Operations	Improve layouts, pricing, routines. Small tweaks compound into big gains.
P	Promote Brand	Keep story visible online and in person. Your reputation is always being built.
D.R.Y. - Guardrails
Letter	Principle	Warning
D	Due Diligence	Verify every claim before you buy. Trust, but verify. Then verify again.
R	Risk Management	Insurance, safety, compliance protect you. Don't cut corners on protection.
Y	Your Eyes Open	Never buy on emotion. No turnkey traps. If it seems too good to be true, it is.
The Doctrine Summary
"Every laundromat can be measured, optimized, and scaled. The math doesn't lie - your habits do."

Chapter 16: Scaling Smart - The Multi-Store Mindset

Growth isn't about adding stores. It's about multiplying systems.

I've seen operators rush to buy a second store before they've figured out the first one. They end up with two mediocre stores instead of one great one.

The 3-Store Rule
Before expanding, you should:

Checkpoint	Requirement	Why It Matters
1	First store runs hands-off for 3 months	Proves your systems work
2	At least one trained manager can replicate your systems	You can't be everywhere
3	Every process documented (opening, closing, cash-out, repairs)	Systems must be teachable
Then - and only then - think about a second store.

Automation Tools for Scaling
Category	Tool Options	Purpose
Payment	FasCard, LaundryLux, SpyderWash	Cashless, remote monitoring
POS	Cents, Curbside Laundries, CleanCloud	Full management suite
Surveillance	Remote cameras with cloud storage	Security and oversight
Maintenance	Maintenance tracking software	Preventive scheduling
Pickup/Delivery	Londr, Hampr, or in-house build	Additional revenue stream
The Scaling Wisdom
"You don't grow by adding chaos. You grow by cloning clarity."

Chapter 17: Selling or Passing the Torch

Every store should be built with the end in mind.

Ask yourself: if you walked away tomorrow, could someone else run your business - or would it crumble without you?

Exit or Legacy Plan
Building a Sellable Business:

Element	What It Means	How to Achieve
Clean books	No cash in pocket, everything documented	Use proper accounting software
Updated P&L	Monthly statements ready for buyer review	Track income and expenses religiously
SOP binder	Operations manual anyone can follow	Document every process
Brand equity	Reputation built through service	Reviews, community presence
True EBITDA	Real numbers, not wishful thinking	Honest assessment of profitability
Valuation Multiples
Typical Sale Prices:

Store Quality	Multiple	Example ($100K EBITDA)
Poor records, distressed	1.5-2.5x EBITDA	$150K-$250K
Average, well-documented	2.5-4x EBITDA	$250K-$400K

Family transition	Legacy preservation	1-3 years
Partner buyout	Partial exit	3-6 months
Merger with competitor	Market consolidation	6-12 months
Assigning a Lease: The Critical Step
From Larry Larsen's expertise

The ability to assign your lease is essential to selling your business. Without it, you're essentially unsellable.

Assignment Considerations:

Factor	Ideal Situation	Problematic Situation
Landlord approval	Not required, or reasonable standards	Sole discretion of landlord
Transfer fee	None or minimal	Percentage of sale price
Continued liability	Released upon assignment	Remain liable for full term
New lease terms	Same as existing	Landlord can renegotiate
The Final Doctrine
"Your business should outlive your burnout. Build it so someone else can run it - whether that's a buyer, a family member, or a manager."

Chapter 18: The AI Revolution in Laundromats

How artificial intelligence is transforming every aspect of laundromat operations

AI-Integrated Smart Laundromat

Figure 18.1: The modern AI-integrated laundromat features smart equipment with digital displays, IoT sensors for real-time monitoring, robotic assistants, and holographic dashboards showing machine status and analytics.

The Technology Shift
The laundromat industry is experiencing its most significant technological transformation since the introduction of card payment systems. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are no longer futuristic concepts - they're operational realities that separate thriving businesses from struggling ones.

Key AI Applications:

Application	Function	ROI Impact
Predictive Maintenance	Sensors detect failures before they happen	30-50% reduction in downtime
Dynamic Pricing	Adjust prices based on demand patterns	10-20% revenue increase
Customer Service Bots	24/7 automated support and booking	40% reduction in staff calls
Inventory Management	Auto-reorder supplies at optimal times	15% cost savings
Energy Optimization	AI-controlled utility usage	20-35% utility savings
Smart Equipment Integration
Modern washers and dryers from manufacturers like Dexter, Speed Queen, and Continental now come with built-in IoT capabilities:

Real-time monitoring of cycle status, water temperature, and spin speeds
Remote diagnostics that alert you to problems before customers notice
Usage analytics showing peak hours, popular machine sizes, and cycle preferences
Automatic service scheduling based on run hours and performance data
Customer Experience Enhancement
AI transforms how customers interact with your laundromat:

Mobile apps that show real-time machine availability
Predictive wait times based on historical patterns
Personalized promotions triggered by customer behavior
Voice assistants for accessibility and convenience
Automated loyalty programs with smart rewards
Implementation Strategy
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Install basic IoT monitoring on existing equipment
Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Implement customer-facing mobile app
Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Deploy predictive maintenance and dynamic pricing
Phase 4 (Year 2+): Full AI integration with autonomous operations

The Doctrine on AI
"Technology should amplify your systems, not replace your judgment. Use AI to work smarter, but never forget the human touch that builds customer loyalty."

Chapter 20: Hybrid Business Models and Delivery Services

Expanding beyond four walls with pickup/delivery, wash-dry-fold, and multi-service integration

Robot-Assisted Laundry Delivery Hub

Figure 20.1: A modern laundromat with integrated delivery operations showing a robotic assistant handling folded laundry, organized delivery bags, digital route optimization screens, and a professional wash-dry-fold station.

The Evolution of Laundromat Services
The traditional coin-op model is evolving. Today's most profitable laundromats are hybrid operations offering multiple revenue streams:

Service	Margin	Complexity	Growth Potential
Self-service	40-60%	Low	Stable
Wash-dry-fold	50-70%	Medium	High
Pickup/Delivery	30-50%	High	Very High
Commercial accounts	35-55%	Medium	High
Specialty services	60-80%	Medium	Moderate
Building a Delivery Operation
Step 1: Start Small

Begin with a 5-mile radius
Use personal vehicle initially
Set minimum order ($30-$50)
Offer 24-48 hour turnaround
Step 2: Technology Stack

Route optimization software
Customer booking app/website
Driver tracking and communication
Payment processing integration
Step 3: Scale Strategically

Hire dedicated drivers at volume
Expand radius based on demand
Add commercial pickup routes
Partner with apartment complexes
Pricing Delivery Services
Service Level	Price Structure	Target Customer
Basic pickup	Per pound + delivery fee	Budget-conscious
Premium same-day	1.5x base + rush fee	Time-sensitive
Subscription	Monthly flat rate	Regular users
Commercial	Volume discount	Businesses
Technology Partners for Delivery
Curbside Laundries - Full-service platform
Starchup - Route optimization
CleanCloud - POS with delivery
Hampr - Marketplace integration
Multi-Service Integration
Consider adding:

Dry cleaning drop-off/pickup
Alterations and tailoring partnerships
Shoe repair services
Specialty item cleaning (comforters, rugs)
The Doctrine on Expansion
"Your laundromat's four walls are a launching pad, not a limitation. Every service you add is another revenue stream that competitors can't easily replicate."

Appendix D: Water Bill Analysis Tutorial
Water bills are the closest thing to an impartial witness of a laundromat's actual usage.

Figure D.1: Water Bill Analysis Flowchart
Water Bill Analysis Flowchart

The Larry Larsen Method for verifying claimed revenue using water consumption data.

Figure D.2: Water Usage by Machine Type
Water Usage by Machine Type

Reference chart for gallons per cycle by washer type and size.

The Basic Calculation
Step 1: Get 12 months of water bills

Step 2: Calculate average gallons per month

Step 3: Estimate cycles

Average washer uses 15-25 gallons per cycle
Use 20 gallons as a conservative estimate
Step 4: Calculate revenue

(Monthly gallons ÷ 20) × average vend price = estimated washer revenue
Step 5: Add 30-40% for dryer revenue

Step 6: Compare to seller's claimed revenue

Example Analysis
Month	Gallons	Est. Washer Cycles	Est. Washer Revenue
Jan	45,000	2,250	$9,000
Feb	42,000	2,100	$8,400
Mar	48,000	2,400	$9,600
...	...	...	...
If seller claims $15,000/month but water suggests $9,000 - you have a problem.

Red Flags
Water usage inconsistent with revenue claims
Declining water usage trend
Seasonal patterns that don't match claimed revenue
Water bills in someone else's name

Appendix K: First-Time Buyer Q&A
The most common questions Larry and I get from first-time buyers

Getting Started
Q: How much money do I need to buy a laundromat?

A: Plan for $150K-$400K total for an existing store, including:

Purchase price (typically $100K-$300K)
Closing costs ($5K-$15K)
Initial repairs/improvements ($10K-$50K)
Working capital reserve ($10K-$30K)
With financing, you may need 20-30% down ($30K-$120K cash).

Q: Can I do this with no experience?

A: Yes, but you need to compensate with education. Read this book cover to cover. Visit at least 20 laundromats. Talk to operators. Consider hiring a consultant for your first deal. The investment in knowledge pays dividends.

Q: How much time does it really take to manage?

A: First 6-12 months: 15-25 hours/week as you learn and build systems.
After systems are in place: 5-15 hours/week.
With a manager: 2-5 hours/week oversight.

It's not passive income. It's systematized income.

Evaluating Deals
Q: What's the biggest mistake first-time buyers make?

A: Paying too much because they fell in love with the idea. The second biggest: not doing proper due diligence. Use our checklist (Appendix C) religiously. Trust the numbers, not the seller's story.

Q: How do I know if the seller's numbers are real?

A: Cross-reference everything:

Compare water bills to claimed revenue (Appendix D)
Request tax returns (not just P&Ls)
Sit in the store and count customers
Check coin meter readings over time
Ask to see bank deposits
If the seller resists verification, walk away.

Q: What's a good rent-to-revenue ratio?

A: Under 25% is the target. Under 20% is excellent. Over 30% means the math probably doesn't work unless you can significantly grow revenue or renegotiate rent.

Equipment & Operations
Q: Should I buy a store with old equipment?

A: It depends on the price. Old equipment (15+ years) means you're buying a retool project. Factor in $100K-$300K for equipment replacement within 3-5 years. This should be reflected in a lower purchase price.

Q: What's more important: new equipment or good location?

A: Location, without question. You can always upgrade equipment. You can't fix a bad location. I'd rather have old machines in a prime spot than new machines in a dead zone.

Q: How do I handle problem customers?

A: Prevention is better than reaction:

Clear posted rules
Visible cameras
Consistent enforcement
Attendant presence during peak hours
Relationship with local police
For persistent problems, document everything and don't hesitate to ban repeat offenders.

Financing
Q: Will a bank really lend for a laundromat?

A: Yes, but you need to approach the right banks. SBA lenders and specialized industry lenders (Eastern Funding, Dexter Financial) understand this business. Your local bank may not.

Q: Can I get seller financing?

A: Often, yes. Especially if the seller is retiring or motivated. Benefits:

Lower down payment (sometimes 10%)
More flexible terms
Seller has incentive for you to succeed
Easier qualification
Get it in writing with proper legal documentation.

Q: What credit score do I need?

A: For SBA loans: 680+ preferred, 650+ possible.
For equipment financing: 650+ typically.
For seller financing: Negotiable.

Higher scores get better rates. Work on your credit before you start shopping.

Growth & Exit
Q: When should I buy a second store?

A: When your first store:

Has been profitable for 12+ months
Can run without you for 30+ days
Has documented systems anyone can follow
Has a trained manager or reliable attendants
Don't scale chaos. Scale clarity.

Q: How do I increase the value of my laundromat?

A: Focus on:

Growing revenue (better equipment mix, services, marketing)
Cutting costs (utility efficiency, smart staffing)
Extending lease (longer = more valuable)
Documenting everything (SOPs, financials)
Building brand (reviews, reputation)
Every dollar of additional EBITDA adds value at sale.

Q: Should I ever partner with someone?

A: Partnership can work if:

You have complementary skills (one operates, one finances)
You have a detailed operating agreement
Exit terms are defined upfront
You genuinely trust each other
Most partnerships fail because expectations weren't aligned from the start. Get everything in writing.

The Doctrine on Trends
"Trends are just patterns waiting to be leveraged. The operator who sees them first and acts decisively will own the market while others are still reading articles about what's happening."

Epilogue: The Legacy Load
My grandfather hauled quarters.
My dad hauled washers.
I hauled myself back from a wheelchair.

We all built something - not just for money, but for meaning.

This business has been in my blood for three generations. It's paid for homes, educated children, and weathered recessions. It's given people second chances - including me.

When I was lying in that hospital bed after my stroke at 36, wondering if I'd ever walk again, I didn't think about stock portfolios or crypto gains. I thought about the fundamentals: family, purpose, and building something that lasts.

The laundromat business taught me that.

Form over function. Structure over emotion. Design over guesswork.

That doctrine got me out of that wheelchair. It's the same doctrine that will make your laundromat profitable.

If this book gives you even one "aha" moment, one better lease, one smarter upgrade, then my family's legacy lives on through you.

The laundromat business doesn't just wash clothes.
It cleans up lives - one cycle at a time.

Now it's your turn. Go build something that lasts.
