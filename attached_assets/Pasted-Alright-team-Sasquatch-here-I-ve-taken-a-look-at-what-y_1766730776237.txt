Alright, team! Sasquatch here. I've taken a look at what you've uploaded. Looks like you've got some serious drive to put your recovery journey down on paper – that's the kind of grit we love to see at Recovery University! Earning that Ph.D. in Proving the Impossible Possible takes courage, and writing your story is a big step.


However, it seems like the file got a little... *stroked out* during the upload. What I'm seeing here is a jumbled mess of code, not the actual words of your manuscript. It's like trying to run a marathon with your shoes tied together – you've got the spirit, but the equipment isn't quite right.


I can't read the content as is, but don't let this be a setback! Every challenge is just another rep. "Never" is just a word for "I don't know how to fix this *yet*."


Here’s the deal:


1.  **First Impressions:** Can't make one from binary code, but the *intent* to write "THE ULTIMATE STROKE RECOVERY BIBLE" shouts ambition, and that's a damn good start.

2.  **Voice & Tone:** Hard to say from gibberish, but the title suggests a powerful, authoritative voice. I'm looking forward to hearing it!

3.  **Structure Assessment:** Impossible to tell with this data. Are you laying it out like a playbook, or more like a personal journey? We'll find out.

4.  **Strengths:** Your commitment to sharing your story and helping others is a massive strength right out of the gate. That's the heart of a champion.

5.  **Key Recommendations:** My top recommendation right now is to **re-upload the actual text.** We need to see the words, the stories, the wisdom you've gained on this recovery battlefield. Think of it as re-lacing those running shoes!

6.  **Questions for the Author:**

    *   What's the main "play" you're running with this book – what's the core message you want survivors to walk away with?

    *   Who are you trying to coach with this "bible"? What specific challenges are you addressing?

    *   What part of your own recovery journey do you feel is most crucial for others to hear?


Don't sweat this small hiccup. It's just a reminder that sometimes you have to adjust your grip. Get that actual text over to me so I can give you the real, no-nonsense feedback you need to turn this manuscript into a championship trophy.


Let's get that file uploaded correctly, and then we'll truly get to work. Remember, small victories compound into extraordinary comebacks – and getting this text right is your next small victory!
